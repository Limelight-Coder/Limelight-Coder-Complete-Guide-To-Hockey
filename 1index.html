<h1> Where did hockey originate?</h1>
<br><br><br>
<h3 style="margin: 36px;">In 1876, the first Hockey Association was established in the UK, and it created the first official set of regulations. The initial association only lasted six years before nine founding member clubs decided to resurrect it in 1886. Hockey's origins go all the way back to ancient times. According to historical accounts, a primitive version of the game was played in Egypt 4,500 years ago, in Ethiopia around 1,000 BC, and in Iran around 2,000 BC. </h3>

<br><br><br>
<h3 style="margin: 36px;">Various museums offer evidence that a form of the game was played by the Romans and Greeks as well as by the Aztecs several centuries before Columbus arrived in the New World.
    The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century and is largely attributed to the growth of public schools, such as Eton.</h3>
<br><br><br>
  <h3  style="margin: 36px;">In 1908, the first men's Olympic hockey competition took place in London, featuring separate competitions for England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. The competition had six teams after the admission of France and Germany.
    Hockey made its debut at the London Games, but after host nations were given power over "optional sports," hockey was removed from the Stockholm Games in 1912. Following lobbying from Belgian hockey supporters, it made a comeback in Antwerp in 1920 before being dropped once more in Paris in 1924.
    The International Hockey Federation was established in 1924, which was not in time for the Olympics in Paris, but it did allow hockey to return in Amsterdam in 1928. Since then, hockey has been included on the programme, with women's hockey being added for the first time.</h3>
